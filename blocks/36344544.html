			<div class='block'><p > NOVEMBER 19 // LOG </p>
<p > The day started off with Ali cornering the group in a Teams group chat asking us where their work was for Research Methods because it was overdue (they never started). Aiyana and Celine came up with a panicked response while Nehir was dead asleep. The group got a couple days extra which meant that all work on the quilt had to come to a halt. The group met up with the rest of the Research Methods class to go to a field trip to Art Metropole. Everyone looked around and Nehir bought some books. The class migrated over to Issues where Aiyana bought a magazine. </p></div>
