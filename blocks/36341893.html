<p > The group talked about how they were missing a couple of things in their kit. Nehir and Aiyana went to Michaels together to pick up a pin cushion, hook needles, and threaders. The two of them went to Tuck Shop and got some drinks to go. They also bought hot sauce for the collective sixth floor and did a poll to see. They ignored all suggestions and bought the one the two of them wanted instead. Celine, Nehir, and Aiyana met up to keep working on the blanket. Aiyana had to go to class and Celine and Nehir kept working on it. The two of them watched Lego Ninjago (Celine’s favourite movie) while working. </p></div>
