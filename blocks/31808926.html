<ol > <li > <p > Nehir and Aiyana went thrifting for sheets including the base color to the Value Village in Queen East. We came up with a selection of sheets and made a color palette. Celine helped us choose the base color on FaceTime. We bought them and came back. On our way back, we were kind of hungry so I recommended to Aiyana that she needs to try this restaurant and she liked it. </p> </li><li > <p > Celine really added to and processes the manifesto document. Nehir found a few formats we could use for our manifesto. </p> </li><li > <p > Aiyana suggested that we should photographically record the process in as many formats as possible. </p> </li><li > <p > I showed the resource "Making & Being" to the girls as something that responds directly to the economy we're creating (I found it on Ali's are.na). Aiyana pinpointed the area that corresponded and skimmed through it and summarized it during crit. </p> </li><li > <p > I (Nehir) started this log. </p> </li><li > <p > Celine accepted to do most of the explaining in crit. Aiyana and I added. </p> </li><li > <p > Alex(andre) carried some of the sheets across rooms when we were switching rooms for class. </p> </li><li > <p > Sanchari, Jill, Alexandre, Ali gave feedback for our consideration. Ali offered help in accessing an embroidery machine for our possible typographic experimentation. </p> </li> </ol>
