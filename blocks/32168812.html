Aiyana showed Celine the Tchaikovsky and Meck correspondences while Alex djed in the background. They both cried about the letters Aiyana and Celine went to the party and met up with Nehir. Celine was a cat maid, Nehir was a flapper girl, Aiyana was the working class (came right after work).<br></br>Nehir won one of the costume contests. Aiyana and Nehir lost their couple’s costume contest (The Bourgeois and 1844 Manuscript of Estranged Labour by Karl Marx).
