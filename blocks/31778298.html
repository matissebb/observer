			<div class='block'><p > OCTOBER 28 // LOG // THE ADDITION OF LABOUR </p>
<ol > <li > <p > Olivia Reynolds<br></br>Olivia saw a bag of fabric being thrown out in her apartment complex and texted Aiyana asking if we were still working on the quilt and if we would like it. In the time that it took for me to respond, it was thrown out but Olivia went and fished in the trash for it. This contribution of fabric was quite literally massive as now there's a piece of fabric that might be big enough to act as the backing portion of the quilt. Nehir and I walked over to her apartment to pick up the bags of fabric. She also furthered our journey by letting us know about Affordable Textiles having a bin of fabric that you could get some discarded pieces for $10 and that there was a variety to choose from. </p> </li><li > <p > Downtown Textiles<br></br>Along the way to Olivia's apartment, we were in the fashion district of Toronto. The first store that we realized was next to us and sold fabric was Downtown Textiles. Before we even formulated the thought to go in, the owner, Daniel, ushered us in. Immediately his personality was grandiose, and bubbling. He also put us immediately to work. He was rolling up a long roll of fabric and it was spilling off to the side, he made us take either side of it and straightened it out while he was rolling. "Don't let it touch the ground!" he said and we obliged. After this, he asked us if we were students and what we were doing and we told him about our project and he showed us around. We thought gingham might be a good addition so we bought a yard from him. </p> </li> </ol>
<p > While we were checking out we asked if he's ever made a quilt and he said yes. He told us to take process pictures and to show him. Daniel also told us that if we needed help with it that we can bring it in and he would teach us. </p>
<ol start = "3"> <li > <p > Celine Fabric Collection<br></br>Celine brought in her collection of fabrics from her previous quilting project and thrift finds. It now lives in the locker along with the other fabrics that we collected. </p> </li><li > <p > Alexandra Maftei + Textiles Department<br></br>Alexandra let us know about the textiles department and their reuse depot pile of fabrics that are available to be used. She also offered to help us out in that department if needed and if we needed a specific measuring tape for textiles that her mom happens to own. </p> </li><li > <p > Measuring Fabrics<br></br>Once we brought the assortment of fabrics back to OCAD, we used the measuring tape that I bought and the one that came with the trash to do an InDesign kind of rulers. </p> </li> </ol>
<p > Thank you for the matcha before Research Methods Nehir <3 -Aiyana </p></div>
