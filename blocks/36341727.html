			<div class='block'><p > NOVEMBER 14 // LOG<br></br>This was the actual production day. Aiyana brought a bunch of equipment and visited Celine at work beforehand to brief what the day was going to look like. The group booked out 552 for consecutive 3 hour periods. Nehir brought some cushions for the group to sit on. Aiyana and Nehir started sewing while listening to dj sets on the speaker. Alex and his friend Hannah popped by to see what we were doing. Hannah has experience sewing and making quilts so she offered to sit down with us and help sew. Celine joined after her shift and got down to help us sew. Joginder did us a favour and extended us the whole day so we didn’t have to sign in and out all the equipment we used. After the dj sets, the group started S1 of The Rehearsal. Took a break to go watch Alex DJ in a INTM studio with Hannah. Alexandra came by to help us document and to sit and help sew on the floor for a while. The gang all together took another break by going to the 100M workshop and watched Amir and Aaryan talk about devices and algorithms. Aiyana afterwards went with Alex and Hannah to watch their friend Finn DJ! </p>
<p > Definitely our biggest day so far. </p></div>
