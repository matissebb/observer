This form of documentation has its limits however because the labour it represents is purely from what is put into the quilt. Labour such as our coffee buying example would not be shown.<br></br>-Scrapbook<br></br>-> Display our labour as the artifacts that represent the labour that was put in rather than the labour itself? Maybe? Would shift the focus to be more expansive of what is considered labour?<br></br>->Maybe Ali might say it's a bit cliche or kitschy? </p></div>
