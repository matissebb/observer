<p > The group met up at a room in the library, focusing on their own work that had to get done. The gang had a late start in their day. Others like Jan, Josh, Alexandra, trickled in the room for the Research Methods lecture. Everyone watched Vera van de Seyps lecture on her work and found it really interesting. Afterwards, Nehir, Aiyana, Josh, and Alexandra organized and went to go give a talk in Roderick’s class about their Hot Mess posters. After the lecture Aiyana and Nehir reunited with Celine in the library and watched The Substance in a study room on the projector. </p></div>
