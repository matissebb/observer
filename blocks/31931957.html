<p > <strong > FIRST OFFICIAL DAY OF QUILTING </strong><br></br>The girls came to school on a Sunday!! Celine and Aiyana did lunch run, they got Bahn Mi and a brownie for Nehir. Shoutout Karine's for the free cookie. </p>
<p > We decided on lined fabric for the backing (also cut it a bit wrong oops), We went back and forth between patches and looking at inspiration while cutting fabric. We intuitively decided to work background to foreground, and pinned down the cut pieces. We also made a list of our must haves for the quilt.<br></br>. </p>
<p > <strong > Here is a non-exhaustive list of some other activities we got up to: </strong> </p>
<ul > <li > <p > Talked about the rehearsal </p> </li><li > <p > Listened to donuts by J Dilla as per Adam's recommendation </p> </li><li > <p > Played with Blitzy Bingsu slime </p> </li><li > <p > Watched the sunset together </p> </li><li > <p > Listened to since i left you by the avalanches </p> </li><li > <p > Collectively did an exquisite corpse of a patch to kick things off </p> </li> </ul></div>
