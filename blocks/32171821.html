			<div class='block'><p > NOVEMBER 12 // LOG<br></br>The group worked with friends in the library. The three worked on the manifesto simultaneously attempting different parts at once. Celine bought an Aussie Lemonade flavoured Monster energy drink for us to try because she thought it was good (it was). Celine, Nehir, and Aiyana added each other on the same period tracking app. They also compared each other's personality compatibility on the app Dimensional. Watched Rebecca Wilkinson do a lecture on labour and then right after went to see Michael Prokopow's sabbatical talk. Aiyana and Celine went to Tuck Shop for dinner because Nehir has been recommending it for a while now. Nehir has been 2/2 on place recommendations. They reconvened in The Learning Zone to work more on the manifesto before their crit time at 7:00pm. Ali looked at the manifesto and gave feedback. Also provided suggestions. Ali now has access to the manifesto </p></div>
