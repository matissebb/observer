<p > Early in the morning, Celine and Nehir went on a run with Alex before working on the quilt. Aiyana met up with Celine and Nehir and settled down in a classroom to start working. Before starting, Aiyana brought deco stickers and toploaders so the group could decorate their own how they wanted to. They watched Easy A. the rest of The Rehearsal and Ru Paul’s Drag Race. In between Celine and Aiyana went to grab Shah’s. Aiyana brought Tarot Cards to do readings of everyone and also the quilt. They listened to the album Maybe We Could  by Kllo. They cut more pieces and stitched already existing pieces onto the quilt. They worked from sun up to sun down. </p></div>
