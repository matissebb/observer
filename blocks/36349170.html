			<div class='block'><p > NOVEMBER 25 // LOG<br></br>Nehir, Celine, and Aiyana faced the toughest day yet. The day before the final crit and things were not finished. The group worked together all day and late into the night to stitch things down. They grabbed pizza and ate together. They watched Love Island (begrudgingly made nehir watch it) and watched Gilmore Girls. In the midst of the madness Nehir and Aiyana went to Research Methods while Celine skipped. Nehir ironed all the pieces and also got a prick from working on it. People came by to check in and chat as the group was quilting away. When it was really late, Nehir went home, and Aiyana and Celine decided to extend the late night to an all night without telling Nehir so she could sleep. They took turns working on the quilt and napping. They listened to all of Brockhampton’s albums and miscellaneous One Direction. </p></div>
