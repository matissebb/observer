						<p > OCTOBER 28 // LOG // THE ADDITION OF LABOUR </p>
<ol > <li > <p > Olivia Reynolds<br></br>Olivia saw a bag of fabric being thrown out in her apartment complex and texted Aiyana asking if we were still working on the quilt and if we would like it. In the time that it took for me to respond, it was thrown out but Olivia went and fished in the trash for it. This contribution of fabric was quite literally massive as now there's a piece of fabric that might be big enough to act as the backing portion of the quilt. Nehir and I walked over to her apartment to pick up the bags of fabric. She also furthered our journey by letting us know about Affordable Textiles having a bin of fabric that you could get some discarded pieces for $10 and that there was a variety to choose from. </p> </li><li > <p > Downtown Textiles<br></br>Along the way to Olivia's apartment, we were in the fashion district of Toronto. The first store that we realized was next to us and sold fabric was Downtown Textiles. Before we even formulated the thought to go in, the owner, Daniel, ushered us in. Immediately his personality was grandiose, and bubbling. He also put us immediately to work. He was rolling up a long roll of fabric and it was spilling off to the side, he made us take either side of it and straightened it out while he was rolling. "Don't let it touch the ground!" he said and we obliged. After this, he asked us if we were students and what we were doing and we told him about our project and he showed us around. We thought gingham might be a good addition so we bought a yard from him. </p> </li> </ol>
<p > While we were checking out we asked if he's ever made a quilt and he said yes. He told us to take process pictures and to show him. Daniel also told us that if we needed help with it that we can bring it in and he would teach us. </p>
<ol start = "3"> <li > <p > Celine Fabric Collection<br></br>Celine brought in her collection of fabrics from her previous quilting project and thrift finds. It now lives in the locker along with the other fabrics that we collected. </p> </li><li > <p > Alexandra Maftei + Textiles Department<br></br>Alexandra let us know about the textiles department and their reuse depot pile of fabrics that are available to be used. She also offered to help us out in that department if needed and if we needed a specific measuring tape for textiles that her mom happens to own. </p> </li><li > <p > Measuring Fabrics<br></br>Once we brought the assortment of fabrics back to OCAD, we used the measuring tape that I bought and the one that came with the trash to do an InDesign kind of rulers. </p> </li> </ol>
<p > Thank you for the matcha before Research Methods Nehir <3 -Aiyana </p>

<ol > <li > <p > Nehir and Aiyana went thrifting for sheets including the base color to the Value Village in Queen East. We came up with a selection of sheets and made a color palette. Celine helped us choose the base color on FaceTime. We bought them and came back. On our way back, we were kind of hungry so I recommended to Aiyana that she needs to try this restaurant and she liked it. </p> </li><li > <p > Celine really added to and processes the manifesto document. Nehir found a few formats we could use for our manifesto. </p> </li><li > <p > Aiyana suggested that we should photographically record the process in as many formats as possible. </p> </li><li > <p > I showed the resource "Making & Being" to the girls as something that responds directly to the economy we're creating (I found it on Ali's are.na). Aiyana pinpointed the area that corresponded and skimmed through it and summarized it during crit. </p> </li><li > <p > I (Nehir) started this log. </p> </li><li > <p > Celine accepted to do most of the explaining in crit. Aiyana and I added. </p> </li><li > <p > Alex(andre) carried some of the sheets across rooms when we were switching rooms for class. </p> </li><li > <p > Sanchari, Jill, Alexandre, Ali gave feedback for our consideration.

						<p > NOVEMBER 9 // LOG<br></br>Aiyana and Celine hung out at Alex’s apartment before going to Miki’s Halloween party. Aiyana showed Celine the Tchaikovsky and Meck correspondences while Alex djed in the background. They both cried about the letters Aiyana and Celine went to the party and met up with Nehir. Celine was a cat maid, Nehir was a flapper girl, Aiyana was the working class (came right after work).<br></br>Nehir won one of the costume contests. Aiyana and Nehir lost their couple’s costume contest (The Bourgeois and 1844 Manuscript of Estranged Labour by Karl Marx). Aiyana told Nehir to read the Tchaikovsky section in her own copy of the annual. </p>

<p > The group talked about how they were missing a couple of things in their kit. Nehir and Aiyana went to Michaels together to pick up a pin cushion, hook needles, and threaders. The two of them went to Tuck Shop and got some drinks to go. They also bought hot sauce for the collective sixth floor and did a poll to see. They ignored all suggestions and bought the one the two of them wanted instead. Celine, Nehir, and Aiyana met up to keep working on the blanket. Aiyana had to go to class and Celine and Nehir kept working on it. The two of them watched Lego Ninjago (Celine’s favourite movie) while working. </p>

<p > Early in the morning, Celine and Nehir went on a run with Alex before working on the quilt. Aiyana met up with Celine and Nehir and settled down in a classroom to start working. Before starting, Aiyana brought deco stickers and toploaders so the group could decorate their own how they wanted to. They watched Easy A. the rest of The Rehearsal and Ru Paul’s Drag Race. In between Celine and Aiyana went to grab Shah’s. Aiyana brought Tarot Cards to do readings of everyone and also the quilt. They listened to the album Maybe We Could  by Kllo. They cut more pieces and stitched already existing pieces onto the quilt. They worked from sun up to sun down. </p>

<p > The group met up at a room in the library, focusing on their own work that had to get done. The gang had a late start in their day. Others like Jan, Josh, Alexandra, trickled in the room for the Research Methods lecture. Everyone watched Vera van de Seyps lecture on her work and found it really interesting. Afterwards, Nehir, Aiyana, Josh, and Alexandra organized and went to go give a talk in Roderick’s class about their Hot Mess posters. After the lecture Aiyana and Nehir reunited with Celine in the library and watched The Substance in a study room on the projector. </p>

<p > The day started off with Ali cornering the group in a Teams group chat asking us where their work was for Research Methods because it was overdue (they never started). Aiyana and Celine came up with a panicked response while Nehir was dead asleep. The group got a couple days extra which meant that all work on the quilt had to come to a halt. The group met up with the rest of the Research Methods class to go to a field trip to Art Metropole. Everyone looked around and Nehir bought some books. The class migrated over to Issues where Aiyana bought a magazine. </p>
