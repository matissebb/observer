<p > -> i'm not trying to "convert" any of the information in a way to be digestible for my oscilloscope beforehand. rather, letting the machine do the understanding and the "talking". </p>

<p > -> thus a bit more of a pivot to a more personal relationship<br></br>-> 24-hour recording of a day in my life<br></br>-> more diverse compilations of things </p></div>
