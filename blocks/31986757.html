			<div class='block'><p > NOVEMBER 5 // LOG<br></br>Aiyana brought a steamer from home and the group did their best to steam the wrinkles out of the blanket. Nehir brought Aiyana a lemon ginger wellness shot because they're still sick. They repinned the edges down on the organic shape. Made some more patches and added it to the quilt. Olivia delivered the thrifted finds of fabric and quilting books. While Nehir was on a side quest, a man came up to us and asked if we were making a quilt. He then pulled out a flyer for Pacita Abad's AGO exhibition from his inner jacket and showed us. We ate the chips that Celine bought on Sunday. We got crit from Ali who essentially told us to keep going. </p></div>
