<p > I've been using Emacs for the past 6-8 months and I've grown to like it quite a lot. I shifted to it when I was doing C programming and eventually wanted to do some Lisp. </p>
<p > I moved with ideas of extreme configurability and the awesomeness of Org mode. But I never got into Org mode (because of inferior portability compared to markdown) and I didn't get that into configuring emacs. I did some playing around, wrote some Elisp functions and had a nice workflow going, but I think its been pretty clunky. Things work but they're not as lighweight as nvim I'd say. And I don't think thats what emacs is, 'Emacs is an OS'. </p>
<p > So yeah, I think for now, I want something lighter. But I've learned a lot of things from emacs in terms of interaction possibilities. How you navigate through your system, how to spawn and keep servers running etc. </p>
<p > I think I wanna bring those things back and use TMUX + Nvim combo to sort of rebuild that. Keeping focus on simplicity so things are easy to change. </p>
<p > And maybe at some point I can also look at fennel, and possibly write my config in that? </p>
<p > We'll see... </p></div>
