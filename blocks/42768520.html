<p > The idea is to take the interface of are.na canvas, so positioning, zooming, draggin etc and then combine it with the engine of the publication tool, essentially giving me a node based procedural publication design tool. </p>
<h3 > Proof of concept: </h3>

<p > Essentially will have views for drawable tings, so here is a circle for example. </p>
<p > This circle can be connected to a canvas and it will show the circle. </p>
<p > Messages can be sent to the circle, such as x = 50, or y = 150, etc to set the properties of the circle by connecting nodes to the Circle obj. </p>
<p > when circle changes it propagates this change to the canvas. </p></div>
